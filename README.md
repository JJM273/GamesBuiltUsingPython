# *Games built using PYTHON:* 
Built a few games while learning Python.
###### (*Their descriptions are given in their respective folders.*)

### 0. [Guessing Game](https://github.com/tusharnankani/GamesBuiltUsingPython/tree/master/Guessing_Game) 
* Advanced.
### 1. [Hangman](https://github.com/tusharnankani/GamesBuiltUsingPython/tree/master/Hangman_Game)
* With 400+ words. 
### 2. [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/tusharnankani/GamesBuiltUsingPython/tree/master/RockPaperScissors_Game)
* With the computer.
### 3. [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/tusharnankani/GamesBuiltUsingPython/tree/master/TicTacToe_Game)
* A 2-Player Game, sitting on the same computer.
* SIMPLE.
* ADVANCED.
* 1-Player Game added.
  * [Tic Tac Toe AI Upgrade](https://github.com/tusharnankani/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI)
##
## NOTE: I have just built the logic for these games till now; and they can just be played on the Command Line (Terminal)/Jupyter Notebooks.
### *NEXT GOAL:*
#### 0. Building GUI for all the games, using the `tkinter` module.
#### 1. ~~Adding AI, building another mode for TIC-TAC-TOE playing with the *Computer* - Levels (Easy/Difficult) ~~
  - [Tic Tac Toe AI Upgrade](https://github.com/tusharnankani/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI)
#### 2. Building a Machine Learning Model for playing Rock Paper Scissors, real-time with the Computer, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
