# Games built using PYTHON:
Built a few games while learning Python.
### 1. Guessing Game 
* Advanced
### 2. Rock Paper Scissors
* With the computer
### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe 
* A 2-Player Game, sitting on the same computer.
* SIMPLE
* ADVANCED
##
## NOTE: I have just built the logic for these games till now; and they can just be played on the Command Line (Terminal)/Jupyter Notebooks.
### NEXT GOAL:
#### 1. Building GUI for all the games, using tkinter module.
#### 2. Building another mode for TIC-TAC-TOE playing with the Computer - Levels (Easy/Intermediate/Difficult) 
#### 3. Building a Machine Learning Model for Rock Paper Scissors with the Computer, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Camera of the PC.
