### *NEXT GOAL:*
#### 0. Building GUI for all the games, using tkinter module.
#### 1. Building another mode for TIC-TAC-TOE playing with the *Computer* - Levels (Easy/Intermediate/Difficult) 
#### 2. Building a Machine Learning Model for Rock Paper Scissors with the Computer, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Camera of the PC.
